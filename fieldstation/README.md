# FieldPrism User Manual

## GUI and Usage 
- Critical features are visualized in the GUI.
- All QC / diagnostic messages are output in the terminal.
- Preview window is center crop of the live camera feed, updates ~3fps.
- Saved image window will show the image you just captured. It shows the file that was written to the storage device. If you don't see a photo in the window, then nothing was saved.
- Since the live camera feed is slow, count to 3 before taking a photo after you make final adjustments to the specimen / subject.
- Insufficient power delivery can cause several, strange issues. If you see an "Input/Output" error (in the terminal), then you need to supply more power.
- The R Pi cannot deliver enough power for all components simultaneously. I recommend running the camera on a separate power bank, or at least using a power bank that is rated to charge multiple devices at the same time (at least 2 USB-A ports).
