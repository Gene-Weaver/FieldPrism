# Thanks for using FieldPrism (FP) and FieldStation (FS)! Here are a few tips:

# ----- GUI and Usage ------------------------------------
#      - Critical features are visualized in the GUI.
#      - All QC / diagnostic messages are output in the terminal

#      - Preview window is center crop of the live camera feed, updates ~3fps

#      - Saved image window will show the image you just captured. It shows the file that
#        was written to the storage device. If you don't see a photo in the window, then
#        nothing was saved.  

#      - Since the live camera feed is slow, count to 3 before taking a photo after you 
#        make final adjustments to the specimen / subject.

#      - Insufficient power delivery can cause several, strange issues. If you see
#        an "Input/Output" error (in the terminal), then you need to supply more power.
#      - The R Pi cannot deliver enough power for all components simultaneously. I recommend
#        running the camera on a separate power bank, or at least using a power bank that 
#        is rated to charge multiple devices at the same time (at least 2 USB-A ports)

# ----- Storage ------------------------------------
#      - FieldPrism can write all data (images and CSV files) to up to 6 USB storage devices.
#        (This is hard coded, not dynamic)
#      - On each FieldPrism startup, you *MUST* run the Mount USB command
#      - If you remove or add a USB drive, you *MUST* run the Mount USB command
#      - Errors and unexpected behavior will occur if you do not run the Mount USB command 
#        after each time that a USB drive is moved/added/removed 
#      - If you get an "Input/Output" error (in the terminal) it is caused by 
#        insufficient power delivery
#      - You can save images to the boot SD card, but it is strongly not recommended

# ----- Mount USB Commands ------------------------------------
#      - Can be run in three ways
#      1. (Recommended) double click the Mount USB + icon on the desktop
#         * If successful, the mounted drives that are visible on the desktop should 
#           flash around, disappear, reappear
#         * Insepct the terminal output and look for errors
#      2. In the terminal...
#         * cd into the FieldPrism folder:   cd FieldPrism/fieldstation
#         * run:    python mount_usb_drives.py
#         * verify that the terminal output makes sense
#      3. In the terminal...
#         * cd into the FieldPrism folder:   cd FieldPrism/fieldstation
#         * run:    sh ./mount_usb_drives.sh
#         * verify that the terminal output makes sense

# ----- USB Speed ------------------------------------
#      - In the GUI, if USB Speed is not 'HIGH', then the USB cable connecting the camera to
#        the Raspberry Pi is not capbable of high-speed data transfer. Replace it.

# ----- GPS ------------------------------------
#      - See https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-ultimate-gps.pdf
#      - The GPS will routinely timeout if not in use
#      - Press the '2' key to wake it up without saving data or taking a photo
#      - Time is reported in UTC time (aka. Greenwich Mean Time)  
#      - GPS Speed: You can change the way FS gets a GPS point, but the default should
#        work most of the time
#            * 'fast' takes ~0.3sec. to get a fix 
#            * 'cautious' takes ~1.5sec.
#        Cautious adds a tiny delay to allow GPS lock and waits for 10 successful pings
#        Fast has no delay and only waits for 3 successful pings

# ----- Time ------------------------------------
#      - If there is no GPS signal, then the time will be based on the R Pi clock, which
#        is likely to be wrong since it needs the internet to update. 

# ----- Time ------------------------------------
#      - All data is saved to two files:
#            1. A session CSV, new each time you launch FS
#            2. A cummulative CSV, all data rows
#      - Session CSVs are a backup

# ----- Mapping Keys ------------------------------------
#      - If you use a mini keyboard other than the one we validated, you should verify 
#        that the default key values of your keyboard. Connect it to any PC / MAC, see
#        what each key press returns, map your keys in the config file below
#      - Feel free to change the values to suite you

# ----- Camera Rotation ------------------------------------
#      - Take a photo. If it looks strange in the Saved Image Window then adjust the 
#        rotation options below
#      - Setting both rotations parameters to True will rotate image 270 degrees CW
